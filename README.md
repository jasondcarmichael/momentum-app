# Momentum App
Slight twist on the "To Do" list. This app is designed to help you track and celebrate all the small wins and accomplishments achieved each day.

The name illustrates the purpose of the app: Get into action with small victories that build momentum and get you into your flow.

It's a shift of focus: from all the tasks you need to complete to the things you have actually done. We tend to focus on the endless list of things we need to do and lose sight of what we've actually accomplished.

Hopefully, it's a shift of attitude. While we cannot control the results of our actions, we can show up each day and take positive steps toward our goals. Rather than feeling overwhelmed by our to do lists, we can take a moment to celebrate our wins.
